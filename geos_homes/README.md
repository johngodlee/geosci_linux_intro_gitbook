# Making use of your personal GeoSciences Homepage

All PGR students and staff in the School of GeoSciences get access to a personal web page, hosted on the GeoSciences web server. You can see a [list of existing pages here](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes). 

These pages are a good way of advertising yourself as a researcher and are a good place to link to other pages and projects you are involved in.

# Logging into the GeoSciences Linux system

There are three main ways to access systems running Linux in the School of GeoSciences:

- Login directly to a GeoSciences Linux workstation, which access the Linux servers by default
- Login to a GeoSciences Windows machine and connect to a Linux server remotely
- Login to a Linux server remotely from your personal computer, when connected to the University VPN

By far the most common way to access Linux is to use a GeoSciences Windows machine and connect to a Linux server remotely, though using a personal computer or laptop is becoming more popular.

Most of the tasks you will need to use a Linux server for can be achieved through a command line interface like the one in the picture below:

But you can also login using conventional graphical user interface. Some programs even require a graphical user interface (GUI), which looks like the image below:
